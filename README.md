# Integrate OpenAI into Your Code with Semantic Kernel

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Integrate OpenAI into Your Code with Semantic Kernel](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/integrate-openai-into-your-code-with-semantic-kernel/).

## Running the Code

Review the **Cheat Sheets** folder for instructions on running each of the demos. You will need two environment variables set up:

- `AzureOpenAIEndpoint` -- The full URL of your Azure OpenAI endpoint. I recommend using a region like East US 2 or West US, as they have support for GPT-4. Also, as of December 2023, you will need to be whitelisted into the Azure OpenAI program for your use case.
- `AzureOpenAIKey` -- One of the access keys for your Azure OpenAI service.

If you have an OpenAI account rather than an Azure OpenAI account, note that you can change the code to support this but that there may be minor code differences.
